## My first real game.

## How to play:
- You are the orange color
- You conquer case by clicking on white case that next to yours
- You can conquer 1 white case per turn
- When you turn end other color play
- If one of the case next to you are of another color you enter in conflict
- In case of conflict if you are bigger then you conquer like you do with white case
- Otherwise you are conquered
- You can't conquer white case if you are in conflict
- When you have completly conquered another color you can conquer 1 more per turn
- You win if you conquer all other color
- You lose if you are conquered
